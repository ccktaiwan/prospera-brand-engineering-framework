PURPOSE

This document defines the maturity model
for Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis.

Maturity describes the quality, completeness,
and reliability of diagnostic execution,
not business success or brand strength.

Maturity is assessed only after lifecycle
completion conditions are met.

==================================================

MATURITY CONCEPT

Phase 1 maturity evaluates whether the diagnostic
output is sufficiently reliable to serve as a
foundation for downstream brand engineering work.

Maturity is not continuous.
It is assessed against explicit criteria
and classified into discrete levels.

==================================================

MATURITY LEVELS

Phase 1 defines four maturity levels:

Level 0 – Absent  
Level 1 – Fragmented  
Level 2 – Structured  
Level 3 – Verified

Only Level 2 or higher is considered
eligible for Phase 2 entry.

==================================================

LEVEL DEFINITIONS

LEVEL 0 – ABSENT

Description:
No meaningful diagnostic execution exists.

Characteristics:
- No external data
- No competitive context
- No articulated baseline

Interpretation:
Brand understanding is entirely assumption-based.

==================================================

LEVEL 1 – FRAGMENTED

Description:
Partial diagnostic signals exist,
but lack structure or coherence.

Characteristics:
- Anecdotal or isolated data points
- Overreliance on personal networks
- No cross-source validation

Risk:
Creates false confidence and misdirected decisions.

==================================================

LEVEL 2 – STRUCTURED

Description:
Diagnostic scope is clearly defined
and systematically executed.

Characteristics:
- Multiple external data sources
- Consistent diagnostic structure
- Internal vs external gaps identified

This level establishes a usable diagnostic baseline.

==================================================

LEVEL 3 – VERIFIED

Description:
Diagnostic outputs are externally grounded
and internally validated.

Characteristics:
- Cross-source consistency confirmed
- Competitive benchmarks applied
- Diagnostic assumptions explicitly tested

This level supports high-confidence
structural and strategic decisions.

==================================================

MATURITY ASSESSMENT RULES

- Maturity is assessed only after lifecycle completion
- Maturity assessment is evidence-based
- Self-declared maturity is not permitted
- Advancement requires documented justification

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO GOVERNANCE

Maturity assessment:

- Does not grant authority
- Does not imply readiness for execution
- Does not override lifecycle constraints

It solely determines eligibility
for downstream phase consideration.
