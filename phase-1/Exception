VERSION: 1.0.0

==================================================

PURPOSE

This document defines the exception policy
for Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis.

Exceptions allow limited deviation from
standard diagnostic execution
without constituting a violation.

Exceptions do not negate lifecycle requirements.
They must be explicit, bounded, and documented.

==================================================

EXCEPTION PRINCIPLE

An exception is a governed deviation,
not an informal shortcut.

All exceptions must:
- Preserve diagnostic intent
- Maintain external grounding
- Be explicitly declared and recorded

Implicit exceptions are not permitted.

==================================================

PERMISSIBLE EXCEPTION CATEGORIES

Phase 1 permits exceptions only
under the following categories:

1. Data Accessibility Constraint
2. Market Novelty Constraint
3. Time-Bound Discovery Constraint

No other exception categories are valid.

==================================================

CATEGORY 1: DATA ACCESSIBILITY CONSTRAINT

Definition:
External data sources are partially unavailable
due to platform limitations, legal restrictions,
or early-stage market opacity.

Permitted Adjustments:
- Use of proxy indicators
- Expanded qualitative sampling
- Temporary exclusion of non-critical signals

Requirements:
- Constraint must be explicitly stated
- Substituted indicators must be documented
- Impact on diagnostic confidence noted

==================================================

CATEGORY 2: MARKET NOVELTY CONSTRAINT

Definition:
The brand operates in a newly formed
or rapidly emerging market
with limited historical or comparative data.

Permitted Adjustments:
- Reduced competitive benchmarking
- Emphasis on adjacent market signals
- Scenario-based diagnostic framing

Requirements:
- Novelty condition explicitly declared
- Adjacent market rationale documented
- Assumptions clearly labeled as provisional

==================================================

CATEGORY 3: TIME-BOUND DISCOVERY CONSTRAINT

Definition:
Phase 1 is intentionally time-boxed
to enable early-stage decision gating.

Permitted Adjustments:
- Narrowed diagnostic scope
- Prioritization of high-impact signals
- Deferred secondary indicators

Requirements:
- Time boundary explicitly defined
- Deferred elements listed
- Follow-up diagnostic commitment recorded

==================================================

NON-PERMISSIBLE EXCEPTIONS

The following are never valid exceptions:

- Founder belief or authority
- Internal consensus
- Historical success claims
- Anecdotal reassurance

These constitute evidence substitution
and are classified as violations.

==================================================

EXCEPTION DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

All exceptions must include:

- Exception category
- Scope of deviation
- Rationale
- Impact on diagnostic confidence
- Review or expiration condition

Undocumented exceptions are invalid.

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO VIOLATIONS

Exceptions differ from violations:

- Exceptions are declared and bounded
- Violations are implicit or ungoverned

An exception exceeding its declared bounds
automatically becomes a violation.
