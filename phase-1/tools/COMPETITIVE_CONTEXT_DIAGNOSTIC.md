==================================================

PURPOSE

This diagnostic evaluates the competitive context
in which the brand is actually interpreted,
not the competitors the organization believes it faces.

It answers a critical question:

"When an external observer encounters this brand,
what alternatives are mentally compared?"

This tool clarifies contextual competition,
not market share or performance ranking.

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC SCOPE

The Competitive Context Diagnostic examines
the reference frame used by the market
to interpret brand meaning.

It focuses on category adjacency,
substitution logic, and positioning overlap.

Internal competitor lists are explicitly excluded.

==================================================

CORE DIMENSIONS

Competitive context is assessed across four dimensions.

DIMENSION 1
Category Framing

Assesses how the brand is categorized
by external observers.

Observation areas include:
- Primary category association
- Secondary or adjacent categories
- Category ambiguity signals

DIMENSION 2
Substitution Logic

Assesses what alternatives
the brand is compared against
when decisions are made.

Observation areas include:
- Functional substitutes
- Perceptual substitutes
- Non-obvious comparison sets

DIMENSION 3
Positioning Overlap

Assesses whether the brand’s claimed space
overlaps with others in confusing ways.

Observation areas include:
- Message similarity
- Value proposition redundancy
- Differentiation clarity gaps

DIMENSION 4
Reference Competitor Set

Assesses whether the brand’s
perceived competitors differ
from its assumed competitors.

Observation areas include:
- Market narratives
- Third-party comparisons
- Customer language patterns

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC METHOD

This diagnostic relies on:

- External narrative analysis
- Public comparison signals
- First-time observer framing

Internal strategic intent
must not be used to define context.

==================================================

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Findings from this diagnostic must include:

- Observed Competitive Context Summary
- Dominant Comparison Frames
- Contextual Misalignment Indicators
- Category Ambiguity Risks

Outputs must remain descriptive.
No repositioning or differentiation actions
are defined at this stage.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This diagnostic does NOT:

- Rank competitors
- Evaluate competitive strength
- Recommend positioning strategy
- Define differentiation tactics

Its role is to reveal
the competitive frame of reference only.

==================================================

MATURITY CONTRIBUTION

This tool contributes primarily to:

Phase 1 Maturity Levels:
- Level 2 (Structured)
- Level 3 (Verified)

Unclear competitive context
limits diagnostic reliability.

==================================================

AI USAGE NOTE

AI systems may assist in:

- Identifying comparison patterns
- Mapping category adjacency
- Surfacing substitution logic

AI systems must not:

- Suggest repositioning
- Define competitive advantage
- Infer strategic intent
