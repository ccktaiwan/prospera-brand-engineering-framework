==================================================

PURPOSE

This diagnostic evaluates whether a brand
is discoverable by non-connected audiences.

It answers a single foundational question:

"If a potential customer does not know us,
can they reasonably find us?"

This tool measures external visibility,
not internal effort or reputation.

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC SCOPE

The Market Visibility Diagnostic examines
brand presence across public discovery surfaces.

It focuses on signals accessible to
first-time, unaffiliated observers.

Internal channels and personal networks
are explicitly excluded.

==================================================

CORE DIMENSIONS

Visibility is assessed across four dimensions.

DIMENSION 1
Search Discoverability

Assesses whether the brand appears
in relevant search contexts.

Observation areas include:
- Brand name search presence
- Category or problem-based search presence
- Search result completeness and clarity

DIMENSION 2
Platform Presence

Assesses whether the brand is visible
on platforms where trust is formed.

Observation areas include:
- Official website accessibility
- Primary social or industry platforms
- Consistency of basic brand information

DIMENSION 3
Baseline Awareness Signals

Assesses whether the brand leaves
recognizable public traces.

Observation areas include:
- Mentions, references, or citations
- Reviews or third-party signals
- Content footprint discoverability

DIMENSION 4
Entry Barrier for First Contact

Assesses how difficult it is
for a new prospect to understand
what the brand does and why it exists.

Observation areas include:
- Clarity of value proposition
- Ease of initial understanding
- Absence of confusion or ambiguity

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC METHOD

This diagnostic relies on:

- Publicly observable data
- Non-authenticated access paths
- First-impression perspectives

No internal analytics,
paid data,
or privileged access is required.

The diagnostic is intentionally lightweight
to reduce execution friction.

==================================================

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Findings from this diagnostic must include:

- Visibility Presence Summary
- Key Gaps in Discoverability
- Notable Absences or Weak Signals
- Immediate Risk Indicators

Outputs must remain descriptive.
Interpretation and recommendation
are explicitly prohibited at this stage.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This diagnostic does NOT:

- Evaluate brand quality
- Assess marketing effectiveness
- Recommend SEO or platform actions
- Judge competitive superiority

Its role is to establish visibility reality only.

==================================================

MATURITY CONTRIBUTION

This tool contributes primarily to:

Phase 1 Maturity Levels:
- Level 1 (Fragmented)
- Level 2 (Structured)

It cannot independently justify
Level 3 (Verified) maturity.

==================================================

AI USAGE NOTE

AI systems may assist in:

- Aggregating observable signals
- Structuring findings
- Highlighting inconsistencies

AI systems must not:

- Interpret intent
- Infer causality
- Suggest corrective actions
