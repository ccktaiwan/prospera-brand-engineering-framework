==================================================

PURPOSE

This diagnostic evaluates whether the organization
is structurally prepared to scale its brand
beyond founder-dependent growth.

It answers a critical question:

"Can the brand operate, decide, and scale
without relying on the founder’s continuous involvement?"

This tool assesses organizational readiness,
not brand strength or market success.

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC SCOPE

The Brand Maturity Diagnostic examines
internal structures that enable or block
brand scalability.

It focuses on decision ownership,
process clarity, and dependency patterns.

Market performance is intentionally excluded.

==================================================

CORE DIMENSIONS

Brand maturity is assessed across four dimensions.

DIMENSION 1
Decision Ownership

Assesses whether brand-related decisions
have clear ownership beyond the founder.

Observation areas include:
- Decision clarity
- Delegation boundaries
- Escalation dependency

DIMENSION 2
Process Repeatability

Assesses whether brand execution
follows repeatable processes.

Observation areas include:
- Documented workflows
- Consistency across initiatives
- Reliance on ad-hoc coordination

DIMENSION 3
Knowledge Externalization

Assesses whether brand knowledge
exists outside individual memory.

Observation areas include:
- Written guidelines
- Shared references
- Onboarding effectiveness

DIMENSION 4
Founder Dependency Load

Assesses the extent to which
brand outcomes depend on founder intervention.

Observation areas include:
- Approval bottlenecks
- Founder-as-integrator role
- Single-point-of-failure risk

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC METHOD

This diagnostic relies on:

- Structured observation
- Interview-based evidence
- Artifact inspection (not performance metrics)

It avoids financial KPIs
to prevent conflating revenue with maturity.

==================================================

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Findings from this diagnostic must include:

- Maturity Pattern Summary
- Primary Dependency Risks
- Structural Bottlenecks Identified
- Readiness Constraints for Scaling

Outputs must remain descriptive.
No remediation or restructuring
is defined at this stage.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This diagnostic does NOT:

- Evaluate leadership quality
- Recommend organizational changes
- Assess operational efficiency
- Judge team performance

Its role is to reveal structural readiness only.

==================================================

MATURITY CONTRIBUTION

This tool contributes primarily to:

Phase 1 Maturity Levels:
- Level 2 (Structured)
- Level 3 (Verified)

It is a prerequisite
for any credible Phase 2 work.

==================================================

AI USAGE NOTE

AI systems may assist in:

- Structuring interview insights
- Identifying dependency patterns
- Highlighting consistency gaps

AI systems must not:

- Assign blame
- Propose organizational redesign
- Infer intent or capability
