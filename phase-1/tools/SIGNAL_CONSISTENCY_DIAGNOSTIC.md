==================================================

PURPOSE

This diagnostic evaluates whether the brand
emits a coherent and interpretable signal
to external audiences.

It answers a critical question:

"Do different touchpoints tell the same story,
or do they compete with each other?"

This tool assesses signal alignment,
not content quality or creative execution.

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC SCOPE

The Signal Consistency Diagnostic examines
how the brand is represented across
external-facing surfaces.

It focuses on message coherence,
terminology stability, and narrative alignment.

Internal intent is explicitly excluded.

==================================================

CORE DIMENSIONS

Signal consistency is assessed across four dimensions.

DIMENSION 1
Message Alignment

Assesses whether core messages remain consistent
across channels and contexts.

Observation areas include:
- Repeated value claims
- Terminology stability
- Narrative focus drift

DIMENSION 2
Visual and Structural Coherence

Assesses whether visual and structural elements
reinforce or dilute the brand signal.

Observation areas include:
- Layout consistency
- Visual hierarchy
- Structural emphasis patterns

DIMENSION 3
Channel Role Clarity

Assesses whether each channel
serves a clear and non-conflicting role.

Observation areas include:
- Website vs social distinction
- Sales vs marketing overlap
- Informational vs promotional confusion

DIMENSION 4
Audience Interpretability

Assesses how easily an external observer
can form a clear understanding
of what the brand represents.

Observation areas include:
- Cognitive load
- Ambiguity points
- Conflicting cues

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC METHOD

This diagnostic relies on:

- Cross-channel comparison
- First-time observer perspective
- Non-insider interpretation

Internal rationale or intent
must not be used to justify inconsistency.

==================================================

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Findings from this diagnostic must include:

- Consistency Pattern Summary
- Major Signal Conflicts Identified
- Areas of Message Drift
- Interpretation Risk Indicators

Outputs must remain descriptive.
No harmonization or messaging fixes
are defined at this stage.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This diagnostic does NOT:

- Judge creativity or aesthetics
- Define brand messaging
- Recommend channel strategy
- Optimize content performance

Its role is to expose signal coherence only.

==================================================

MATURITY CONTRIBUTION

This tool contributes primarily to:

Phase 1 Maturity Levels:
- Level 2 (Structured)
- Level 3 (Verified)

High inconsistency limits
verified diagnostic confidence.

==================================================

AI USAGE NOTE

AI systems may assist in:

- Cross-channel comparison
- Pattern detection
- Highlighting contradictions

AI systems must not:

- Propose unified messaging
- Rewrite content
- Infer strategic intent
