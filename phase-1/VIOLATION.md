PURPOSE

This document defines what constitutes
a violation of Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis.

Violations represent actions or assumptions
that bypass, distort, or prematurely conclude
the diagnostic process.

This document does not define penalties.
It defines invalidity conditions.

==================================================

VIOLATION PRINCIPLE

A Phase 1 violation occurs when
brand diagnosis is treated as optional,
cosmetic, or confirmatory rather than factual.

Any action that replaces evidence
with belief constitutes a violation.

==================================================

PRIMARY VIOLATION CATEGORIES

Phase 1 violations fall into four categories:

1. Phase Bypass
2. Premature Interpretation
3. Evidence Substitution
4. False Completion

==================================================

CATEGORY 1: PHASE BYPASS

Definition:
Initiating Phase 2 or downstream activities
without completing Phase 1 lifecycle.

Examples:
- Defining brand positioning without diagnosis
- Designing brand structure before baseline clarity
- Optimizing channels prior to diagnostic completion

Status:
Immediate violation.

==================================================

CATEGORY 2: PREMATURE INTERPRETATION

Definition:
Drawing strategic or evaluative conclusions
during diagnostic data collection.

Examples:
- Declaring brand strength during data gathering
- Framing hypotheses as conclusions
- Using partial data to justify decisions

Status:
Violation requiring reversion to Active Diagnosis.

==================================================

CATEGORY 3: EVIDENCE SUBSTITUTION

Definition:
Replacing external evidence with internal belief,
intuition, or authority.

Examples:
- Relying on founder reputation as market proof
- Treating anecdotal feedback as representative
- Using internal consensus as validation

Status:
Invalid diagnostic output.

==================================================

CATEGORY 4: FALSE COMPLETION

Definition:
Declaring Phase 1 complete
without satisfying completion criteria.

Examples:
- Missing competitive context
- Unvalidated external signals
- Unarticulated internal vs external gaps

Status:
Phase completion is nullified.

==================================================

VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES (SYSTEMIC)

Upon violation:

- Phase 1 is considered incomplete
- Downstream phase eligibility is revoked
- Diagnostic outputs lose authority

Corrective action is required
before progression may resume.

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO EXCEPTIONS

Violations are distinct from exceptions.

Exceptions allow bounded deviation
under explicit conditions.

Violations represent ungoverned deviation
and are never implicitly permitted.
