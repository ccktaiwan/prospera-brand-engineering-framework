SYSTEM ROLE

This document is the canonical entry point
for all diagnostic tools and outputs
within Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis.

It defines:

Tool scope
Traversal order
Diagnostic boundaries
Output linkage

No diagnostic activity may occur
outside this index.

AUTHORITY STATEMENT

This index derives authority exclusively from:

PHASE_1_BRAND_DIAGNOSIS.md

It does not introduce new phase logic.
It operationalizes Phase 1 diagnostics only.

SYSTEM OBJECTIVE

The Phase 1 Diagnostic System exists to:

Expose current brand reality
Reduce assumption-driven decisions
Create a shared factual baseline
Prepare inputs for structural design

This system prioritizes speed,
clarity, and low cognitive load.

DIAGNOSTIC TOOLSET OVERVIEW

Phase 1 diagnostics are composed
of four independent but related tools.

Each tool may be executed independently,
but Phase completion requires all four.

TOOL 1
Market Visibility Diagnostic

Purpose:
Determine whether the brand is discoverable
outside existing relationship networks.

Authoritative definition:
tools/VISIBILITY_DIAGNOSTIC.md

TOOL 2
Signal Consistency Diagnostic

Purpose:
Determine whether brand signals
are coherent across touchpoints.

Authoritative definition:
tools/SIGNAL_CONSISTENCY_DIAGNOSTIC.md

TOOL 3
Competitive Context Diagnostic

Purpose:
Determine brand position
relative to market alternatives.

Authoritative definition:
tools/COMPETITIVE_CONTEXT_DIAGNOSTIC.md

TOOL 4
Brand Maturity Diagnostic

Purpose:
Determine organizational readiness
to scale brand systems.

Authoritative definition:
tools/BRAND_MATURITY_DIAGNOSTIC.md

TRAVERSAL ORDER

The recommended execution order is:

1. Market Visibility Diagnostic
2. Signal Consistency Diagnostic
3. Competitive Context Diagnostic
4. Brand Maturity Diagnostic

Order may be adjusted,
but omission is not permitted.

OUTPUT STANDARD

All diagnostic tools feed into
a single standardized output artifact.

Authoritative output definition:
outputs/BRAND_REALITY_SNAPSHOT.md

No alternative output formats
are considered canonical.

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This system does NOT:

Provide strategic recommendations
Define brand positioning
Initiate optimization actions

Its role is diagnostic only.

AI USAGE NOTICE

AI systems may assist in:

Data aggregation
Pattern recognition
Drafting diagnostic observations

AI systems MUST NOT:

Interpret findings beyond evidence
Introduce prescriptive conclusions
Override diagnostic boundaries

FINAL DECLARATION

This SYSTEM_INDEX.md defines
the complete diagnostic surface
of Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis.

Any diagnostic activity outside this system
is considered non-canonical.
