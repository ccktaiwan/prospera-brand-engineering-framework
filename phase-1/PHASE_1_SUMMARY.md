==================================================

PURPOSE

This document consolidates the outputs
of all Phase 1 diagnostic tools into
a single, decision-ready summary.

It establishes a shared factual baseline
for leadership and system progression.

This summary contains no recommendations.
It contains observable truths only.

==================================================

PHASE 1 DIAGNOSTIC SCOPE

Phase 1 integrates findings from
four diagnostic instruments:

1. Market Visibility Diagnostic
2. Brand Maturity Diagnostic
3. Signal Consistency Diagnostic
4. Competitive Context Diagnostic

Each tool contributes a distinct lens.
No single tool is sufficient in isolation.

==================================================

DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLIDATION FRAME

Phase 1 findings are consolidated
across four factual dimensions.

DIMENSION A
External Discoverability Reality

Derived from:
- Market Visibility Diagnostic

Captures whether the brand is
findable and interpretable
by non-connected audiences.

==================================================

DIMENSION B
Internal Scalability Readiness

Derived from:
- Brand Maturity Diagnostic

Captures whether the brand
can operate and scale
without founder dependency.

==================================================

DIMENSION C
Signal Coherence Integrity

Derived from:
- Signal Consistency Diagnostic

Captures whether external touchpoints
reinforce a coherent understanding
or create interpretive friction.

==================================================

DIMENSION D
Competitive Interpretation Context

Derived from:
- Competitive Context Diagnostic

Captures how the market frames
the brand relative to alternatives,
regardless of internal assumptions.

==================================================

SUMMARY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

A valid Phase 1 summary MUST include:

- Key visibility gaps observed
- Structural maturity constraints identified
- Major signal conflicts documented
- Actual competitive reference frames noted

All statements must be evidence-grounded.
Inference and solutioning are prohibited.

==================================================

DECISION IMPLICATION

This summary serves as the sole
eligibility input for Phase 2.

If Phase 1 maturity is below Level 2,
or if unresolved violations exist,
Phase 2 initiation is not permitted.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This summary does NOT:

- Define brand strategy
- Propose brand structure
- Recommend corrective actions
- Prioritize initiatives

Those activities belong exclusively
to downstream phases.

==================================================

AI USAGE NOTE

AI systems may assist in:

- Structuring consolidated findings
- Detecting cross-tool patterns
- Highlighting inconsistencies

AI systems must not:

- Generate strategic conclusions
- Suggest next-phase designs
- Reframe findings into recommendations
