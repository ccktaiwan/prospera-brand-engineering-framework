DOCUMENT_NAME: LIFECYCLE
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Phase Lifecycle Definition

PHASE: Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis
VERSION: 1.0.0
STATUS: Active
EFFECTIVE_DATE: 2026-01-19

==================================================

PURPOSE

This document defines the lifecycle state model
for Phase 1 – Brand Diagnosis.

It specifies when Phase 1 begins, how it progresses,
what constitutes completion, and under what conditions
the phase is considered stalled or invalid.

This lifecycle governs execution eligibility.
No downstream phase may begin unless Phase 1
has reached a valid completion state.

==================================================

LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

Phase 1 operates as a gated diagnostic lifecycle.

Its sole purpose is to establish a shared,
evidence-based understanding of current brand reality.

Phase 1 explicitly replaces assumption, intuition,
and internal belief with externally observable facts.

No design, optimization, or growth action
is permitted within this phase.

==================================================

LIFECYCLE STATES

Phase 1 consists of the following lifecycle states:

1. Not Started
2. Initialized
3. Active Diagnosis
4. Validation Review
5. Completed
6. Stalled (Non-terminal)

==================================================

STATE DEFINITIONS

STATE 1: NOT STARTED

Description:
Phase 1 has not yet been initiated.

Conditions:
- No diagnostic scope defined
- No data sources identified
- No formal entry declaration

Permitted Actions:
- None

==================================================

STATE 2: INITIALIZED

Description:
Phase 1 has been formally initiated.

Entry Conditions:
- Phase 1 SYSTEM_INDEX acknowledged
- Diagnostic scope declared
- Data domains identified (but not yet collected)

Constraints:
- No interpretation permitted
- No recommendations permitted

==================================================

STATE 3: ACTIVE DIAGNOSIS

Description:
Diagnostic data is actively being collected
and structured.

Permitted Activities:
- External signal collection
- Internal data aggregation
- Competitive context mapping

Explicitly Prohibited:
- Strategy formulation
- Brand positioning decisions
- Structural redesign

==================================================

STATE 4: VALIDATION REVIEW

Description:
Collected diagnostic outputs are reviewed
for completeness, consistency, and bias.

Validation Focus:
- Data sufficiency
- External grounding
- Cross-source coherence

This state exists to prevent premature conclusions.

==================================================

STATE 5: COMPLETED

Description:
Phase 1 is considered complete.

Completion Criteria (ALL required):
- Diagnostic scope fully covered
- External signals documented
- Internal vs external gaps articulated
- Diagnostic outputs validated

Result:
- A shared diagnostic truth baseline
- Eligibility to enter Phase 2

==================================================

STATE 6: STALLED

Description:
Phase 1 progress has halted.

Typical Causes:
- Missing data access
- Stakeholder resistance
- Scope ambiguity
- Overextension of analysis

Stalled State Properties:
- Non-terminal
- Requires explicit resolution or re-initialization
- Cannot advance to Phase 2

==================================================

NON-GOALS OF PHASE 1

Phase 1 does NOT:

- Define brand strategy
- Optimize channels or signals
- Recommend growth actions
- Judge brand quality or value

Its output is visibility, not judgment.

==================================================

LIFECYCLE GOVERNANCE NOTES

- Phase 1 completion is binary: complete or not complete
- Partial completion is not recognized
- Advancing without completion constitutes a governance violation
- Exceptions require explicit documentation

==================================================
