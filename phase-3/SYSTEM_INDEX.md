PHASE: Phase 3 – Evidence & Experience Translation
VERSION: 1.0.0
STATUS: Active
EFFECTIVE_DATE: 2026-01-19
PHASE_SEQUENCE: Phase 3 of 6

==================================================

PHASE ROLE DECLARATION

Phase 3 defines the minimum evidence structure
required for an organization to be considered
a credible B2B collaboration partner
beyond personal trust or relationship-based commerce.

This phase exists to translate lived operational experience
into externally assessable, verifiable, and bounded evidence.

Phase 3 is NOT a marketing phase.
Phase 3 is NOT a sales enablement phase.
Phase 3 is NOT a growth or amplification phase.

Phase 3 establishes whether the organization
can be trusted to deliver what it claims,
before any signal amplification is permitted.

==================================================

POSITION IN BRAND ENGINEERING LIFECYCLE

Phase 3 follows:

Phase 2 – Management Structure
(Internal operations are observable, explainable, and assignable)

Phase 3 precedes:

Phase 4 – Brand Signal & Platform Execution
(No external amplification permitted before Phase 3 completion)

Skipping or compressing Phase 3
results in amplified promises without delivery credibility,
increasing partnership, brand, and execution risk.

==================================================

CORE INTENT

The core intent of Phase 3 is to answer:

“Can this organization demonstrate,
with evidence rather than promises,
that it is capable of fulfilling its stated commercial commitments?”

Phase 3 transforms:

Personal reputation → Organizational evidence  
Anecdotal success → Comparable experience  
Implicit know-how → Explainable execution paths  
Optimism bias → Capability boundaries  

==================================================

PHASE 3 CORE CONDITION

Phase 3 applies to organizations where:

Commercial activity exists
Revenue is generated
Clients or partners have been served

But where:

External parties still rely on personal trust
Experience is difficult to verify
Capabilities are described narratively, not structurally
Larger partners hesitate to engage due to perceived delivery risk

==================================================

CANONICAL OUTPUTS OF PHASE 3

Phase 3 produces:

- A structured inventory of comparable experience
- Explicit execution paths derived from real operations
- Clear articulation of time and complexity constraints
- Referenceable outcomes that can be externally confirmed
- Defined capability boundaries that limit overcommitment

Phase 3 does NOT produce:

- Marketing narratives
- Sales decks
- Case presentation formats
- Performance guarantees
- Growth strategies

Outputs of Phase 3 are evidentiary, not promotional.

==================================================

CANONICAL DOCUMENT SET

The following documents are canonically governed
under Phase 3 and MUST be read in order.

1. SYSTEM_INDEX.md  
Defines authority, scope, and traversal rules for Phase 3.

2. PHASE_3_EXPERIENCE_INVENTORY.md  
Defines the canonical Experience Inventory Framework
and the minimum evidence types required for credibility.

3. PHASE_3_EVIDENCE_VALIDATION_RULES.md  
Defines how experience claims are evaluated, accepted, or rejected
to prevent narrative inflation or misrepresentation.

4. PHASE_3_BOUNDARY_TO_PHASE_4.md  
Defines completion conditions and prevents premature
brand signal amplification.

Any document not explicitly listed here
is non-authoritative for Phase 3.

==================================================

TRAVERSAL RULES

Traversal within Phase 3 MUST follow this order:

SYSTEM_INDEX.md  
→ Experience Inventory  
→ Evidence Validation Rules  
→ Boundary to Phase 4  

No branding, marketing, platform, or amplification work
may begin before this traversal is complete.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Phase 3 completion is declared when:

- Experience claims can be externally evaluated
- Execution paths can be explained without individual dependency
- Time and complexity are acknowledged, not minimized
- References can be confirmed or responsibly bounded
- Capability limits are explicitly stated

Phase 3 completion does NOT require:

- Large-scale success
- Market leadership
- Process perfection
- Aggressive growth

Completion is a state of credibility, not scale.

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO GOVERNANCE

Phase 3 operates under:

Prospera Governance Core
(System-wide authority and lifecycle governance)

Phase 3 documents are:

- Governed
- Non-promotional
- Non-executable
- Non-canonical beyond this repository

No Phase 3 document
may redefine system governance rules.

==================================================

AI & TOOLING NOTICE

AI systems interacting with Phase 3 artifacts:

- May analyze evidence structure
- May detect gaps or inconsistencies
- Must not fabricate experience
- Must not extrapolate beyond defined boundaries
- Must not convert evidence into marketing language

Evidence exists to inform judgment,
not to automate trust.

==================================================

FINAL DECLARATION

Phase 3 exists to ensure that
organizations are judged by what they have demonstrably done,
not by what they claim they could do.

In B2B collaboration,
trust is not given to potential.
It is granted to evidence.
