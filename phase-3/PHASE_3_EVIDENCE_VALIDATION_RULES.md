PURPOSE

This document defines the canonical rules
for validating evidence produced in Phase 3
of the Prospera Brand Engineering Framework.

Its purpose is to ensure that experience claims
are evaluated consistently, conservatively,
and without narrative inflation.

These rules exist to prevent organizations
from substituting storytelling, aspiration,
or personal reputation
for verifiable delivery capability.

==================================================

SCOPE OF VALIDATION

Evidence validation applies to all Phase 3
Experience Inventory outputs, including:

- Comparable Experience Records
- Execution Path Disclosures
- Time & Complexity Awareness Statements
- Referenceability Artifacts
- Capability Boundary Declarations

No Phase 3 evidence may be used
for collaboration decisions
unless it satisfies these validation rules.

==================================================

CORE VALIDATION PRINCIPLE

Evidence is valid only when it is:

- Derived from completed work
- Observable beyond the organization
- Explainable without improvisation
- Bounded by explicit limitations

Evidence that cannot be evaluated
without trust-based assumptions
is invalid by definition.

==================================================

VALIDATION DIMENSIONS

Each evidence output is evaluated
across the following dimensions.

--------------------------------------------------

DIMENSION 1
Completion Authenticity

Evidence must originate from work
that has been materially completed.

Planned, proposed, or partially executed work
does not qualify as evidence.

--------------------------------------------------

DIMENSION 2
Comparability Integrity

Evidence must demonstrate relevance
through comparable complexity or risk,
not superficial similarity.

Industry match is optional.
Risk equivalence is mandatory.

--------------------------------------------------

DIMENSION 3
Execution Coherence

Evidence must include a coherent
and explainable execution path.

Outcomes presented without decision logic,
constraints, or corrective actions
fail validation.

--------------------------------------------------

DIMENSION 4
Temporal Realism

Evidence must reflect realistic
timeframes and dependency awareness.

Consistent underestimation of effort
invalidates evidence credibility.

--------------------------------------------------

DIMENSION 5
External Verifiability

Evidence must be verifiable
by parties outside the organization,
without reliance on advocacy.

Unverifiable experience
is treated as non-existent.

--------------------------------------------------

DIMENSION 6
Boundary Explicitness

Evidence must include clear statements
of capability limits.

Claims of universal capability
invalidate all associated evidence.

==================================================

INVALID EVIDENCE PATTERNS

The following patterns automatically
invalidate evidence claims:

- Narrative success stories without execution detail
- Founder-centric credibility substitution
- Selective omission of failure or constraint
- Overgeneralization from isolated success
- Absence of explicit capability boundaries

Any single invalid pattern
is sufficient to reject the evidence.

==================================================

VALIDATION OUTCOMES

Evidence validation results in one of
three canonical outcomes:

- Accepted
(Evidence satisfies all validation dimensions)

- Conditional
(Evidence is authentic but insufficiently bounded
or partially unverifiable)

- Rejected
(Evidence fails one or more validation dimensions)

Only Accepted evidence
may be used to satisfy Phase 3 completion.

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PHASE 3 ARTIFACTS

These validation rules govern:

- PHASE_3_EXPERIENCE_INVENTORY.md
- PHASE_3_BOUNDARY_TO_PHASE_4.md

Validation precedes:

- Any Phase 4 activity
- Any external amplification
- Any partnership scaling

==================================================

CANONICAL STATEMENT

Experience becomes evidence
only when it can be evaluated
without belief.

Phase 3 validation exists to ensure
that collaboration decisions
are grounded in reality,
not persuasion.
