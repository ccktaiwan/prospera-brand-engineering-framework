Prospera Brand Engineering Framework
Phase 5 – Execution (Governed)
Canonical Codex
1. Phase Definition

Phase 5 is the execution phase in which an enterprise permits collaboration activities to occur while explicitly retaining full governance authority over risk, responsibility, and reversibility.

Phase 5 does not represent trust.
Phase 5 represents controlled exposure under enterprise governance.

2. Phase Entry Conditions

Phase 5 SHALL exist if and only if all of the following conditions are met:

Phase 4 eligibility has been formally granted

The canonical Phase 4 → Phase 5 transition has been completed

No unresolved Phase 4 violation is present

If any condition is not satisfied, Phase 5 SHALL be treated as non-existent.

3. Phase Purpose (Enterprise Function)

The sole enterprise function of Phase 5 is:

To allow execution to occur without reducing the enterprise’s ability to pause, suspend, or terminate the collaboration at any time.

Any execution that diminishes enterprise reversibility violates Phase 5 governance.

4. Permitted Actions

During Phase 5, the external partner MAY:

Execute only within explicitly aligned and approved scope

Perform execution only after alignment confirmation

Pause execution immediately upon enterprise instruction

Terminate execution cleanly when instructed

Execution is permitted only while enterprise control remains intact.

5. Prohibited Actions

During Phase 5, the external partner SHALL NOT:

Expand scope without formal re-alignment

Treat execution as entitlement or leverage

Continue execution during suspension

Attempt to negotiate continuation through performance

Assume renewal, escalation, or Phase 6 entry

Any prohibited action constitutes non-canonical execution.

6. Internal State Model

Phase 5 execution SHALL operate exclusively within the following states:

INITIALIZED

ALIGNED

EXECUTING

SUSPENDED

TERMINATED

COMPLETED

Execution MAY occur only in the EXECUTING state.
TERMINATED and COMPLETED are terminal states.

7. Enterprise Interpretation Rules (Decision Table)
| Observed Partner Behavior     | Legal Interpretation | Procurement Interpretation | Management Interpretation  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Executes only after alignment | Defensible liability | Contract-compliant         | Low governance risk        |
| Respects suspension           | Risk controlled      | Cost exposure stopped      | Trust preserved            |
| Expands scope independently   | Liability escalation | Cost overrun risk          | Loss of control            |
| Executes during suspension    | Governance breach    | Unauthorized spend         | Immediate termination risk |

8. Compliance and Violation Consequences
| Violation Type               | Governance Classification | Enterprise Action         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Unauthorized scope expansion | Non-canonical execution   | Suspension or termination |
| Execution during suspension  | Critical breach           | Immediate termination     |
| Negotiation via performance  | Governance manipulation   | Disqualification          |
| Post-completion continuation | Boundary violation        | Mandatory re-evaluation   |
Violations SHALL invalidate Phase 5 compliance.

9. Canonical Closure Statement

Phase 5 is not the phase where partners prove value.
It is the phase where partners prove they can be governed.

Only partners who can be stopped without resistance
are eligible for consideration beyond execution.
