Prospera Brand Engineering Framework
Phase 4 – Artifact Binding & State Compliance Declaration
(Canonical)

==================================================

DOCUMENT IDENTITY

DOCUMENT_NAME: PHASE_4_ARTIFACT_BINDING_STATE_COMPLIANCE_DECLARATION
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Phase Artifact Binding / State Compliance Specification
DOCUMENT_CLASSIFICATION: Governance / Compliance Control
REPOSITORY_NAME: prospera-brand-engineering-framework
VERSION: 1.0
STATUS: Active
APPLICABLE_PHASE: Phase 4
AFFECTED_PHASE: Phase 5 (Gated)

==================================================

SCOPE

This document specifies the mandatory binding and compliance rules
between Phase 4 canonical authorities and all Phase 4 artifacts.

This specification is normative and non-interpretive.

Any Phase 4 artifact that does not comply with this declaration
SHALL be considered non-canonical.

==================================================

NORMATIVE REFERENCES

This specification SHALL be applied in conjunction with:

PHASE_4_CODEX_AUTHORITY

PHASE_4_TO_PHASE_5_STATE_TRANSITION_SPECIFICATION

Terminology such as SHALL, SHALL NOT, IS DEFINED AS, and SHALL BE CONSIDERED
is used in its normative IEC / ISO sense.

==================================================

ARTIFACT CLASSIFICATION

For the purpose of this specification, Phase 4 artifacts are classified as:

Decision Flow Artifacts

Evaluation Checklist Artifacts

Boundary Definition Artifacts

Index and Reference Artifacts

No other artifact class is permitted to participate
in Phase 4 decision authority.

==================================================

BINDING REQUIREMENT

All Phase 4 artifacts SHALL:

Explicitly reference PHASE_4_CODEX_AUTHORITY as the supreme authority

Explicitly reference PHASE_4_TO_PHASE_5_STATE_TRANSITION_SPECIFICATION
for phase transition semantics

Operate strictly within the authority and constraints defined therein

No Phase 4 artifact SHALL introduce independent decision logic.

==================================================

AUTHORITY PRECEDENCE RULE

In the event of any conflict between:

A Phase 4 artifact

PHASE_4_CODEX_AUTHORITY

PHASE_4_TO_PHASE_5_STATE_TRANSITION_SPECIFICATION

The following precedence SHALL apply:

PHASE_4_CODEX_AUTHORITY

PHASE_4_TO_PHASE_5_STATE_TRANSITION_SPECIFICATION

All Phase 4 artifacts

Any artifact behavior violating this precedence
SHALL be invalidated.

==================================================

PROHIBITED ARTIFACT BEHAVIOR

Phase 4 artifacts SHALL NOT:

Grant or imply Phase 5 existence

Override Phase 4 eligibility outcomes

Introduce conditional exceptions

Enable provisional or partial transitions

Reinterpret eligibility as desirability

Any such behavior SHALL be classified
as a framework violation.

==================================================

COMPLIANCE DETERMINATION

An artifact IS DEFINED AS compliant if and only if:

It defers all eligibility authority to Phase 4 Codex

It does not generate independent pass/fail outcomes

It does not reference Phase 5 activities
except through canonical transition states

Non-compliant artifacts SHALL NOT be used
in any Phase 4 evaluation.

==================================================

VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE

If a non-compliant Phase 4 artifact is used:

The Phase 4 evaluation SHALL be considered invalid

Any resulting Phase 5 activity SHALL be non-canonical

The evaluation cycle SHALL be terminated

Re-evaluation MAY occur only after artifact correction.

==================================================

CANONICAL DECLARATION

Phase 4 authority resides in its Codex
and its state-transition specification.

Artifacts are instruments, not authorities.

Any artifact exceeding its binding scope
invalidates the governance chain.
