Phase 4 – Codex Authority Definition

==================================================

DOCUMENT IDENTITY

DOCUMENT_NAME: PHASE_4_CODEX_AUTHORITY
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Phase Canonical Codex
REPOSITORY_NAME: prospera-brand-engineering-framework
VERSION: 1.0
STATUS: Active
PHASE_SEQUENCE: Phase 4 of 6

==================================================

PURPOSE

This document establishes the canonical authority
governing Phase 4 within the Prospera Brand Engineering Framework.

Phase 4 exists to determine whether an organization
may be treated as an eligible collaboration counterpart
by a real external enterprise decision system.

This document does not describe how to collaborate.
It defines whether collaboration is permissible at all.

==================================================

AUTHORITY SCOPE

This Codex is the highest authority for Phase 4.

All Phase 4 artifacts, including but not limited to:

Decision flows

Evaluation checklists

Boundary definitions

Phase indices

derive their legitimacy exclusively from this document.

No Phase 4 artifact may override, reinterpret, or bypass
the authority defined herein.

==================================================

DECISION PERSPECTIVE

Phase 4 is evaluated exclusively from the perspective of
an external enterprise’s internal decision authority.

This includes, but is not limited to:

Executive leadership bodies

Strategy or governance committees

Procurement or partnership approval units

Phase 4 is not evaluated from the perspective of:

The organization seeking collaboration

Marketing or branding functions

Sales or growth objectives

Self-approval is structurally invalid.

==================================================

INVOCATION CONDITIONS

Phase 4 may be invoked only when the following phases
are completed and accepted as canonical:

Phase 1 – Brand Reality Definition

Phase 2 – Failure Map & Constraint Mapping

Phase 3 – Evidence & Experience Validation

If any prerequisite phase is incomplete,
Phase 4 is not callable.

==================================================

CORE AUTHORITY QUESTION

Phase 4 exists to authorize a single determination:

Can this organization be reasonably accepted
as a collaboration-eligible entity
under real enterprise operating conditions?

Phase 4 does not assess desirability.
It assesses acceptability.

==================================================

ELIGIBILITY CONSEQUENCES

If Phase 4 eligibility is granted:

The organization may be classified as collaboration-eligible

Entry into Phase 5 may be permitted

Execution planning may be considered

Eligibility does not imply preference, endorsement, or commitment.

If Phase 4 eligibility is denied:

Phase 5 is structurally inaccessible

No execution, pilot, or delivery activity may proceed

No implied partnership or shared responsibility is permitted

Failure at Phase 4 terminates the current evaluation cycle.

==================================================

BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT

Phase 5 does not exist
for organizations that have not passed Phase 4.

Any attempt to initiate Phase 5 activities
without Phase 4 eligibility
constitutes a framework violation.

Such violations invalidate governance integrity
and render downstream phases non-canonical.

==================================================

CANONICAL DECLARATION

Collaboration eligibility
is a governance determination, not a narrative outcome.

Phase 4 exists to formalize this determination
before any execution, scaling, or amplification occurs.
