DOCUMENT_NAME: PHASE_4_COLLABORATION_DECISION_FLOW
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Phase Collaboration Decision Flow / Canonical

PHASE_SEQUENCE: Phase 4 of 6

PURPOSE
This document defines the canonical decision flow used by external enterprises to evaluate, gate, and approve collaboration with an SME.
Phase 4 is a decision gate based strictly on enterprise risk assessment, execution credibility, dependency boundaries, failure containment, and organizational compatibility.

ENTRY_CONDITIONS
Phase 4 evaluation begins only when all of the following are true:
1. A collaboration inquiry has been received from an external enterprise.
2. Phase 3 evidence of execution is available and satisfiable.
3. The inquiry is beyond price or proposal and requires risk evaluation.

DECISION_FLOW
Start
Receive external collaboration inquiry
Pre-screen: Has Phase 3 evidence
If no, halt and require Phase 3 completion
If yes, proceed to Legal and Risk Gate

Legal and Risk Gate
Verify legal entity, contractable obligation, liability allocation, absence of undisclosed encumbrances
If fail, reject collaboration

Execution Credibility Gate
Verify comparable experience exists
Verify execution path is documented
Verify time and complexity awareness
If fail, reject collaboration

Dependency and Boundary Gate
Verify delivery capability is not dependent on single individual
Verify capability boundaries are documented
If fail, reject collaboration

Failure Containment Gate
Verify failure scenarios are documentable
Verify remedial paths and escalation paths are documentable
If fail, reject or return for re-evaluation

Organizational Compatibility Gate
Verify compatibility with enterprise decision workflows
Verify communication protocols align with enterprise governance expectations
If fail, reject collaboration

Final Decision
If all gates passed, collaboration is approved
Otherwise, collaboration is rejected

DECISION_OUTCOMES
Approved Collaboration: all gates passed and risk is acceptable
Rejected Collaboration: any gate failure without rework potential
Re-evaluate Conditions: incomplete evidence may trigger rework and return to Phase 3

RELATIONSHIP_TO_PHASES
Phase 3 outputs are prerequisites to Phase 4 evaluation
Phase 5 requires Phase 4 collaboration approval before external amplification

DECISION_FLOW_PRINCIPLES
Decision logic flows from risk assessment, through capability verification, to organizational fit
Each gate is a hard stop unless explicit rework conditions are defined
Approvals must be attributable, auditable, and documented
