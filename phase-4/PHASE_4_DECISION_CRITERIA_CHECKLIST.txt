PURPOSE
This document defines the canonical decision criteria checklist used by external enterprises to evaluate collaboration readiness of an SME.
The checklist enumerates factual verification points corresponding to each Phase 4 decision gate.
It is designed for enterprise internal review, not for partner self-declaration.

This checklist does not assign scores, weights, or recommendations.
It records observable facts only.

ENTRY_CONDITIONS
This checklist may be used only when:
1. Phase 3 execution evidence exists and is reviewable.
2. A formal collaboration evaluation has been initiated by an external enterprise.
3. The evaluation involves shared delivery responsibility, brand exposure, or operational dependency.

LEGAL_AND_RISK_CRITERIA
Verify the following facts:
- Legal entity is clearly identified and verifiable.
- Contracts can be executed by the legal entity.
- Liability scope and indemnification boundaries are expressible.
- No unresolved legal disputes materially affecting execution are present.
Record findings without interpretation.

EXECUTION_CREDIBILITY_CRITERIA
Verify the following facts:
- Comparable past engagements exist.
- Comparable engagements are similar in scale or complexity.
- Execution path can be described with decision points and constraints.
- Time estimates include uncertainty acknowledgment.
Record observed evidence only.

DEPENDENCY_AND_BOUNDARY_CRITERIA

ORGANIZATIONAL_COMPATIBILITY_CRITERIA
Verify the following facts:

Record compatibility observations only.

CHECKLIST_USAGE_CONSTRAINTS
This checklist must not be used to:

The checklist exists to determine whether collaboration risk is observable and bounded.
