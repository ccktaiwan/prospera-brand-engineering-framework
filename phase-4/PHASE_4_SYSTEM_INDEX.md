PHASE_SEQUENCE: Phase 4 to Phase 5 Boundary

==================================================

PURPOSE

This document defines the conditions
under which an organization may progress
from Phase 4 to Phase 5.

It exists to prevent premature scaling,
brand amplification, or ecosystem positioning
without verified collaboration readiness.

==================================================

PHASE 4 COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS

An organization may only exit Phase 4
when all of the following are true:

- Collaboration decision criteria can be evaluated without ambiguity
- Execution scope boundaries are explicitly defined
- Responsibility ownership is operationally clear
- Risk exposure is acknowledged and bounded
- External parties can assess collaboration suitability
  without reliance on personal trust alone

==================================================

DISALLOWED TRANSITIONS

An organization must NOT proceed to Phase 5
if any of the following conditions exist:

- Collaboration decisions rely on founder credibility alone
- Execution success depends on informal exceptions
- Risk is minimized through narrative rather than structure
- Capability claims exceed demonstrated boundaries
- Referenceability is implied but not verifiable

==================================================

PHASE 4 IS NOT OPTIONAL

Skipping Phase 4 results in:

- Fragile partnerships
- Reputation risk transfer
- Strategic misalignment
- Scaling of unresolved operational risk

Phase 4 is mandatory for any organization
seeking enterprise-grade collaboration.

==================================================

TRANSITION INTENT

Phase 5 assumes that collaboration eligibility
has already been established.

Phase 5 does not validate eligibility.
Phase 5 operates on its outcome.

==================================================

CANONICAL STATEMENT

Scaling collaboration without eligibility
is not growth.

It is deferred failure.
