DOCUMENT_NAME: PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_QUANTIFICATION_MODEL
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Phase Quantification Model
REPOSITORY_NAME: prospera-brand-engineering-framework
PHASE: Phase 2 – Management Structure
VERSION: 1.0.0
STATUS: Canonical
EFFECTIVE_STAGE: Phase 2 Only

==================================================

PURPOSE

This document defines the canonical quantification model
for Phase 2 management structure.

Its purpose is to translate:

qualitative management failure patterns

and management maturity states

into:

observable scores

comparable risk indicators

externally interpretable brand health signals

This document does NOT define execution, tooling, or optimization.

==================================================

CORE PRINCIPLE

Phase 2 quantification does NOT measure performance.

Phase 2 quantification measures:

Management Visibility
Management Stability
Management Risk Exposure

All scores represent structural clarity,
not outcome quality.

==================================================

WHAT IS BEING QUANTIFIED

Phase 2 quantifies four management dimensions.

These dimensions are selected because they are:

observable without formal departments

present in real SME operations

directly linked to external brand instability

DIMENSION 1 — Responsibility Clarity

Measures whether responsibility is:

explicitly defined

consistently understood

assignable without personal interpretation

Observable signals include:

unclear task ownership

recurring blame cycles

decisions reverting to the owner by default

DIMENSION 2 — Decision Structure Visibility

Measures whether decisions:

follow identifiable paths

have clear escalation logic

can be explained after failure

Observable signals include:

repeated ad-hoc decisions

inconsistent decision outcomes

inability to explain why a decision was made

DIMENSION 3 — Failure Explainability

Measures whether failures:

can be named

can be categorized

can be explained structurally

Observable signals include:

“we just endure it” behavior

normalization of recurring issues

absence of post-failure explanation

DIMENSION 4 — Operational Consistency

Measures whether operations:

behave predictably

vary systematically instead of randomly

produce explainable external experience

Observable signals include:

unstable customer experience

inconsistent delivery quality

reliance on individual heroics

==================================================

SCORING SCALE DEFINITION

Each dimension is scored on a 0–3 scale.

0 — Invisible
Structure does not exist or cannot be described.

1 — Reactive
Structure exists only after problems occur.

2 — Explicit but Unstable
Structure is defined but inconsistently applied.

3 — Stable and Observable
Structure is consistently applied and explainable.

Scores are assigned per dimension independently.

==================================================

INTERPRETING SCORES

Total Phase 2 Management Score Range: 0–12

0–3
Management is largely invisible.
Brand amplification will magnify failure.

4–7
Management exists but is unstable.
Growth will produce volatility and burnout.

8–10
Management is visible and partially stable.
Selective external execution is possible.

11–12
Management is structurally stable.
Brand scaling and signal amplification are viable.

==================================================

TRANSLATION TO BRAND HEALTH SIGNALS

Phase 2 management scores translate into:

Brand reliability perception

Partner trust readiness

Market explainability

Low management scores correlate with:

inconsistent brand meaning

limited customer base expansion

inability to enter trust-based collaborations

High management scores enable:

external clarity

narrative consistency

scalable brand signaling

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PHASE 2 DOCUMENTS

This model is governed by:

PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_DEFINITION.md

PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_FAILURE_MAP.md

PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_MATURITY.md

This model MUST NOT redefine:

management meaning

failure categories

maturity stages

It only quantifies them.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This model does NOT:

prescribe KPIs

evaluate individuals

recommend tools

define execution steps

Its sole function is structural translation.

==================================================

CANONICAL DECLARATION

Management that cannot be seen
cannot be stabilized.

Management that cannot be stabilized
cannot support brand growth.

Phase 2 quantification exists
to make management reality visible
before growth amplifies its weaknesses.
