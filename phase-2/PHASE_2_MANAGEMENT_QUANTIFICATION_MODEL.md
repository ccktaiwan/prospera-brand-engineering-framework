Prospera Brand Engineering Framework
Phase 2 – Management Quantification Model

==================================================

DOCUMENT IDENTITY

DOCUMENT_NAME: PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_QUANTIFICATION_MODEL
DOCUMENT_TYPE: Phase Quantification Specification (Canonical)
REPOSITORY_NAME: prospera-brand-engineering-framework
PHASE: Phase 2 – Management Structure
VERSION: 1.0.0
STATUS: Active
EFFECTIVE_DATE: 2026-01-19

==================================================

AUTHORITY DECLARATION

This document is a canonical Phase 2 artifact.

It is governed by:
- Prospera Governance Core
- Phase 2 System Index
- Phase 2 Management Definition
- Phase 2 Management Failure Map

No section of this document may redefine:
- The meaning of management
- Failure domain taxonomy
- Phase boundaries
- Governance authority

==================================================

MODEL ROLE DECLARATION

The Phase 2 Management Quantification Model exists solely to:

- Translate observed management failures into quantitative markers
- Enable consistent comparison across organizations
- Establish a measurable baseline for management maturity

This model does NOT:
- Define KPIs
- Prescribe targets
- Evaluate individual performance
- Recommend tools or execution methods

==================================================

POSITION IN PHASE 2 TRAVERSAL

This model is introduced ONLY AFTER:

1. Management meaning is canonically defined
2. Management failure domains are explicitly mapped

Traversal order is mandatory:

SYSTEM_INDEX.md  
→ PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_DEFINITION.md  
→ PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_FAILURE_MAP.md  
→ PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_QUANTIFICATION_MODEL.md  

Any quantitative assessment conducted prior to this order
is non-canonical and invalid.

==================================================

QUANTIFICATION PRINCIPLE

Quantification in Phase 2 operates under the following principles:

- Structural, not behavioral
- Observational, not interpretive
- Comparative, not absolute
- Descriptive, not prescriptive

Scores represent visibility and stability of structure,
not quality of people or effort.

==================================================

FAILURE-TO-MARKER TRANSLATION LOGIC

Each management failure domain is translated into:

- Observable indicators
- Binary or ordinal markers
- Non-normative measurements

Markers MUST satisfy all of the following:

- Observable without internal intent inference
- Verifiable through repeated observation
- Independent of individual personality
- Stable across short time intervals

==================================================

MARKER STRUCTURE SPECIFICATION

Each quantitative marker SHALL include:

- Marker ID
- Associated Failure Domain
- Observation Definition
- Scoring Scale
- Interpretation Boundary

Markers MAY NOT include:
- Improvement guidance
- Tool references
- Role-specific instructions

==================================================

SCORING SCALE STANDARD

Unless otherwise specified, Phase 2 markers use a 4-point ordinal scale:

0 = Not observable  
1 = Inconsistently observable  
2 = Consistently observable but unstable  
3 = Consistently observable and stable  

Scores MUST be assigned based on evidence,
not self-reporting or intent claims.

==================================================

AGGREGATION CONSTRAINTS

Marker scores MAY be aggregated:

- Within the same failure domain
- For baseline maturity visibility

Marker scores MAY NOT be aggregated:

- Across different phases
- Into performance rankings
- Into incentive or compensation systems

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO MATURITY MODEL

Quantification outputs serve as inputs to:

PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_MATURITY.md

The maturity model interprets score patterns.
This document does not.

==================================================

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

This model SHALL NOT be used to:

- Justify growth execution
- Trigger brand amplification
- Replace qualitative diagnosis
- Automate management decisions

Use of this model outside Phase 2
constitutes a governance violation.

==================================================

CANONICAL STATEMENT

Management that cannot be observed
cannot be stabilized.

Management that cannot be stabilized
cannot support brand growth.

Phase 2 quantification exists to make
management reality visible
before growth amplifies its weaknesses.
