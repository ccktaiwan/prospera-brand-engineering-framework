PURPOSE

This document defines the canonical management maturity model
for Phase 2 of the Prospera Brand Engineering Framework.

Its purpose is to translate observed management failures
into measurable structural states,
without introducing performance judgment,
optimization goals, or tooling assumptions.

This model exists to answer one question:

“How structurally manageable is this organization today?”

==================================================

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PHASE 2 DOCUMENTS

This maturity model MUST be interpreted only after:

- PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_DEFINITION.md
- PHASE_2_MANAGEMENT_FAILURE_MAP.md

Maturity does not define new failures.
It classifies the severity and stability
of already-identified management failures.

==================================================

CORE PRINCIPLE

Management maturity measures VISIBILITY and CONTROL,
not competence, effort, or intention.

Higher maturity does NOT mean “better people”.
It means:

- Problems can be identified without personal blame
- Repetition can be explained, not normalized
- Responsibility boundaries are visible
- Decisions are traceable

==================================================

MATURITY LEVEL MODEL

Phase 2 defines four discrete maturity levels.

These levels are ordinal, not aspirational.
They describe current structural reality.

--------------------------------------------------

LEVEL 0 – UNMANAGED SURVIVAL

Characteristics:

- Work happens through personal endurance
- Responsibilities are implicit or emotional
- Problems are recognized only after damage occurs
- Failures repeat without explanation
- Decisions depend on specific individuals

External Market Symptoms:

- Existing customers are unstable
- New customers rely on personal trust
- Business cannot be explained clearly to outsiders
- Collaboration requires founder presence

--------------------------------------------------

LEVEL 1 – REACTIVE MANAGEMENT

Characteristics:

- Problems are noticed but addressed case-by-case
- Responsibility is assigned after failure
- Meetings exist but lack decision clarity
- Different people describe problems differently
- Fixes depend on urgency, not structure

External Market Symptoms:

- Revenue exists but does not scale
- Customer experience is inconsistent
- Reputation is anecdotal, not transferable
- Growth stalls when workload increases

--------------------------------------------------

LEVEL 2 – DEFINED MANAGEMENT

Characteristics:

- Core responsibilities are explicitly described
- Common failure patterns are recognized
- Decision paths are visible, even if imperfect
- Repetition is analyzed, not tolerated
- Management language is shared internally

External Market Symptoms:

- Customer experience stabilizes
- Third parties can understand how the business operates
- Collaboration does not require constant founder mediation
- Brand description becomes consistent

--------------------------------------------------

LEVEL 3 – STABLE MANAGEMENT BASELINE

Characteristics:

- Management structure is explicit and shared
- Responsibility boundaries are respected
- Failures trigger structured response
- Decisions can be reviewed and improved
- Internal consistency is maintained under pressure

External Market Symptoms:

- Customer trust becomes repeatable
- Business is explainable to partners and platforms
- Brand signals are coherent across channels
- Organization is structurally ready for amplification

==================================================

ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES

Assessment must be based on:

- Observable behavior
- Repeated outcomes
- Structural explanation

Assessment must NOT be based on:

- Individual performance
- Intentions or effort
- Tool usage
- Revenue size alone

==================================================

BOUNDARY TO NEXT PHASE

Only organizations assessed at:

LEVEL 2 or above

are eligible to proceed to:

Phase 3 – Brand Signal & Platform Execution

Skipping this boundary results in:

- Amplified internal inconsistency
- Misleading metrics
- Brand erosion under scale

==================================================

CANONICAL STATEMENT

Without management maturity,
brand cannot stabilize.

Without stabilization,
growth cannot scale.

Phase 2 maturity exists to ensure
that growth is structurally possible
before it is operationally pursued.
