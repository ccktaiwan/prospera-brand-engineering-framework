PURPOSE

This document defines the canonical management failure patterns
observed in small and mid-sized enterprises that have achieved
commercial existence but lack explicit management structure.

It maps internal management failures
to their corresponding external market symptoms.

This document exists to prevent misdiagnosis of growth problems
as marketing, branding, or channel issues
when they are in fact management failures.

No tools, solutions, or corrective actions are defined here.
This is a visibility and classification document only.

==================================================

PHASE 2 CORE CONDITION (REFERENCE)

Phase 2 applies to organizations where:

Revenue exists  
Customers exist  
Operations continue  

But:

Management is implicit  
Roles are unclear  
Decisions rely on individuals, not systems  
Problems are endured rather than analyzed  

==================================================

MANAGEMENT FAILURE DOMAINS

The following failure domains are consistently observed
across SMEs in the 20–30M annual revenue range.

--------------------------------------------------

FAILURE DOMAIN 1  
Role Ambiguity & Responsibility Blur

Internal Reality:

Roles exist only by habit or seniority  
Accountability is negotiated case by case  
Work overlaps without clear ownership  
Conflicts are resolved emotionally or politically  

External Market Symptoms:

Inconsistent customer experience  
Service quality depends on who is involved  
Clients feel uncertainty, not confidence  
Trust cannot scale beyond personal relationships  

MARKER SLOT DECLARATION

This failure domain is eligible for Phase 2 quantification.

Applicable Quantification Dimensions:
- Responsibility Clarity
- Decision Structure Visibility
- Failure Explainability
- Operational Consistency

Quantification markers MAY be assigned
only after this failure domain
is explicitly observed and tagged
according to Phase 2 tagging rules.

No scoring, weighting, or aggregation
is defined at this level.

--------------------------------------------------

FAILURE DOMAIN 2  
Decision Bottleneck at the Founder

Internal Reality:

Most decisions require owner approval  
Teams wait instead of acting  
No decision criteria or escalation logic  
Founder is exhausted but indispensable  

External Market Symptoms:

Slow response to market changes  
Missed opportunities  
Partners perceive fragility  
Growth plateaus despite demand  

MARKER SLOT DECLARATION

This failure domain is eligible for Phase 2 quantification.

Applicable Quantification Dimensions:
- Decision Structure Visibility
- Responsibility Clarity
- Operational Consistency

Quantification markers MAY be assigned
only after this failure domain
is explicitly observed and tagged
according to Phase 2 tagging rules.

No scoring, weighting, or aggregation
is defined at this level.

--------------------------------------------------

FAILURE DOMAIN 3  
Unobservable Operational Problems

Internal Reality:

Problems are discussed but not documented  
The same issues recur without explanation  
No shared language for failure  
Fixes are reactive and temporary  

External Market Symptoms:

Customer complaints feel random  
Quality appears unstable  
Reputation cannot accumulate  
External trust remains shallow  

MARKER SLOT DECLARATION

This failure domain is eligible for Phase 2 quantification.

Applicable Quantification Dimensions:
- Failure Explainability
- Operational Consistency
- Repeatability

Quantification markers MAY be assigned
only after this failure domain
is explicitly observed and tagged
according to Phase 2 tagging rules.

No scoring, weighting, or aggregation
is defined at this level.

--------------------------------------------------

FAILURE DOMAIN 4  
Revenue Exists Without Predictability

Internal Reality:

Sales occur but are not forecastable  
Customer acquisition depends on relationships  
No stable base for planning or hiring  
Cash flow anxiety persists  

External Market Symptoms:

Brand recognition remains low  
No leverage for partnerships  
Credit-based growth is inaccessible  
Expansion feels risky and personal  

MARKER SLOT DECLARATION

This failure domain is eligible for Phase 2 quantification.

Applicable Quantification Dimensions:
- Operational Consistency
- Repeatability
- Amplification

Quantification markers MAY be assigned
only after this failure domain
is explicitly observed and tagged
according to Phase 2 tagging rules.

No scoring, weighting, or aggregation
is defined at this level.

--------------------------------------------------

FAILURE DOMAIN 5  
Internal Friction Replaces Strategy

Internal Reality:

Energy is consumed by coordination problems  
Meetings resolve symptoms, not causes  
Departments lack functional clarity  
Blame circulates without resolution  

External Market Symptoms:

Brand message feels inconsistent  
Execution varies across channels  
Market perceives noise, not signal  
Brand fails to become referencable  

MARKER SLOT DECLARATION

This failure domain is eligible for Phase 2 quantification.

Applicable Quantification Dimensions:
- Responsibility Clarity
- Decision Structure Visibility
- Operational Consistency

Quantification markers MAY be assigned
only after this failure domain
is explicitly observed and tagged
according to Phase 2 tagging rules.

No scoring, weighting, or aggregation
is defined at this level.

==================================================

QUANTIFICATION TAGGING RULES

This section defines how management failures
may be quantitatively tagged
without redefining their meaning.

Tagging rules exist to enable later-stage
measurement and diagnostic translation.

They do NOT introduce metrics or scores.

TAGGING PRINCIPLES

Each failure domain may receive multiple quantitative tags  
Tags describe observability, not severity  
Tags do not assign blame or performance judgment  
Tags must be directly inferable from observable behavior  

CANONICAL TAG DIMENSIONS

Visibility  
Repeatability  
Dependency  
Delay  
Amplification  

TAGGING CONSTRAINTS

Tags must not redefine failure categories  
Tags must not introduce scoring or weighting  
Tags must not prescribe corrective actions  

Tagging exists solely to enable
structural translation into:

Management maturity assessment  
Brand health diagnostics  
Comparative organizational analysis  

==================================================

FAILURE MAP PRINCIPLES

These failures are structural, not moral  
They are predictable, not accidental  
They appear before any scalable brand activity  
They cannot be fixed by tools alone  

Failure mapping must precede:

KPI definition  
Diagnostic scoring  
AI-assisted analysis  
Brand amplification  

==================================================

BOUNDARY TO NEXT ARTIFACTS

Only after Phase 2 failures are explicitly mapped
and marker slots declared
may the system proceed to:

Quantitative management indicators  
Management maturity scoring  
Brand health index construction  
Diagnostic tooling  

Skipping failure mapping results in:

Metrics without meaning  
Tools reinforcing dysfunction  
Brand scaling internal chaos  

==================================================

CANONICAL STATEMENT

Management failure is not the absence of effort.
It is the absence of structure.

Phase 2 exists to make failure visible
before growth makes it irreversible.
